# 👋 Hi, I'm Deep!

I'm a DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable infrastructure, automating deployment pipelines, and integrating modern AI tooling into developer workflows. I’ve worked across cloud platforms, safety-critical embedded systems, and enterprise SaaS like Salesforce — with a passion for system reliability and developer experience.

## 🧠 Specialized Domains

### 🔒 Safety-Critical Embedded Systems (SIL-2)
- 🚉 Deployed **Matlab/Simulink-generated** code to SIL-2 certified embedded targets
- ⚙️ Built automated deployment pipelines with safety checks, rollback, and traceability
- 🌿 Managed branching strategies, release policies, and configuration versioning
- ✅ Developed scripts to review and validate configuration artifacts prior to deployment
- 📝 Built tools for **automated release note** generation from Git commit history and Jira metadata
- 🧪 Created **virtual lab** environments for simulation, integration testing, and validation workflows
- 🚦 Worked on **train signaling** systems, high-fidelity diagnostic logging, and safety monitoring infrastructure

### ☁️ Salesforce Platform Governance & AI Monitoring
- Built a **custom Salesforce platform and Quote-to-Cash process monitoring system** using ECS + Prometheus + Grafana
- Governed **Salesforce metadata deployments** and platform stability at scale
- Developed **agentic AI integrations** to monitor, validate, and automate deployment steps

### ☁️ Boomi Runtime Architecture on Kubernetes (EKS)
- 🧱 Containerized **Boomi Molecule** components and deployed them as Kubernetes Deployments
- 🚨 Configured **self-healing deployments** via Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes and Prometheus alerts
- 📦 Used shared **RWX volumes (EFS/NFS)** to maintain molecule installation state across pods
- 📊 Integrated **JMX exporters** for Boomi runtime and process-level observability in Grafana
- 📈 Leveraged Cluster **Autoscaler and HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** for usage-based scaling
- 🔄 Automated node clean-up and de-registration workflows
